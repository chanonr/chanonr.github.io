        Born in Paris into an extremely affluent bourgeois family, Ernest Chausson 
        was the sole surviving child of a building contractor who had made his fortune
        assisting Baron Haussmann in the redevelopment of Paris in the 1850s. 
        &lt;p&gt;
            To please his father, Chausson studied law and was appointed a barrister 
            for the Court of Appeals, but had little or no interest in the profession. 
            He frequented the Paris salons, where he met celebrities such as Henri Fantin-Latour, 
            Odilon Redon, and Vincent d'Indy. Before deciding on a musical career, he dabbled 
            in writing and drawing.
        &lt;/p&gt;

       In 1879, at the age of 24, he began attending the composition classes of Massenet 
       at the Paris Conservatoire; Massenet came to regard him as 'an exceptional person 
       and a true artist'. Chausson had already composed some piano pieces and songs. 
       Nevertheless, the earliest manuscripts that have been preserved are those corrected by Massenet.

      would be unlikely to have sanctioned). Although the symphony 
      is often described as being in the key of E minor, its tonal 
      scheme is more complicated. The symphony's first movement moves 
      from B minor (introduction) to E minor, and the work ends with a 
      rondo finale in C major. Thus, as Dika Newlin has pointed out, 
      "in this symphony Mahler returns to the ideal of 'progressive 
      tonality' which he had abandoned in the Sixth". The 
      complexity of the work's tonal scheme was analysed in terms 
      of "interlocking structures" by Graham George.

      In spite of the emotional distractions, during the summer of 
      1910 Mahler worked on his Tenth Symphony, completing the Adagio 
      and drafting four more movements. He and Alma returned 
      to New York in late October 1910, where Mahler threw himself 
      into a busy Philharmonic season of concerts and tours. Around 
      Christmas 1910 he began suffering from a sore throat, which 
      persisted. On 21 February 1911, with a temperature of 
      40 °C (104 °F), Mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement 
      at Carnegie Hall, with a program of mainly new Italian music, 
      including the world premiere of Busoni's Berceuse élégiaque. 
      This was Mahler's last concert. After weeks confined to bed 
      he was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis, a disease to 
      which sufferers from defective heart valves were particularly 
      prone and could be fatal. Mahler did not give up hope; he 
      talked of resuming the concert season, and took a keen interest 
      when one of Alma's compositions was sung at a public recital by 
      the soprano Frances Alda, on 3 March. On 8 April the Mahler 
      family and a permanent nurse left New York on board SS Amerika 
      bound for Europe. They reached Paris ten days later, where Mahler 
      entered a clinic at Neuilly, but there was no improvement; on 11 
      May he was taken by train to the Löw sanatorium in Vienna, where 
      he developed pneumonia and entered a coma. Hundreds had come 
      to the sanitorium during this brief period to show their 
      admiration for the great composer. After receiving treatments 
      of radium to reduce swelling on his legs and morphine for his 
      general ailments, he died on 18 May.
      &lt;p&gt;
      On 22 May 1911 Mahler was buried in the Grinzing cemetery (de), 
      as he had requested, next to his daughter Maria. His tombstone 
      was inscribed only with his name because "any who come to look 
      for me will know who I was and the rest don't need to know." 
      Alma, on doctors' orders, was absent, but among the mourners at 
      a relatively pomp-free funeral were Arnold Schoenberg (whose 
      wreath described Mahler as "the holy Gustav Mahler"), 
      Bruno Walter, Alfred Roller, the Secessionist painter Gustav 
      Klimt, and representatives from many of the great European opera 
      houses. The New York Times, reporting Mahler's death, called 
      him "one of the towering musical figures of his day," but 
      discussed his symphonies mainly in terms of their duration, 
      incidentally exaggerating the length of the Second Symphony 
      to "two hours and forty minutes." In London, The Times 
      obituary said his conducting was "more accomplished than that 
      of any man save Richter," and that his symphonies were "undoubtedly 
      interesting in their union of modern orchestral richness with a 
      melodic simplicity that often approached banality," though it 
      was too early to judge their ultimate worth.
