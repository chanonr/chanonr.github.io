What is this?
-------------

Timeline is a web widget for visualizing temporal data.


Running Timeline
----------------

Timeline consists entirely of static files (javascript libraries,
image files and css files). All you really need is to
serve those resources off a web server without having to install
any special server side functionality. Therefore any web server will do.

Two ways to access the library:

1. If you have a web server running your machine:
  1. Install the Java runtime from Sun if your OS doesn't have it already (get it for free at http://www.java.com)
  2. Install Apache Ant (get it for free at http://ant.apache.org)
  3. Open a shell or command prompt in the same directory of this file and type:

    ```sh
    ant
    ```
    Ant will use the `build.xml` configuration file to construct and the script will copy all the required files in the give path.
2. No web server? The timeline project includes a small webserver to get you started:
  1. Install the Java runtime from Sun if your OS doesn't have it already
    (get it for free at http://www.java.com)
  2. Open a shell or command prompt in the same directory of this file.
    In windows run:

    ```bat
    run
    ```
    In unix/macosx run:

    ```sh
    ./run
    ```
    and then point your browser to

    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:9999/timeline/
    ```
